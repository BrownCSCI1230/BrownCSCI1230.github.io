<h1 id="mentor-meetings-guide"><a href="#mentor-meetings-guide">Mentor Meetings Guide</a></h1>
<p>As a CS 1230 TA, you will be meeting with your assigned students on a weekly basis in order to gauge their progress in the course and understanding of the material through project grading and, optionally, lab checkoffs.</p>
<h2 id="before-your-meetings"><a href="#before-your-meetings">Before your meetings</a></h2>
<h3 id="find-the-submission-commit-id"><a href="#find-the-submission-commit-id">Find the submission commit id</a></h3>
<p>On Sunday after 10:30 AM ET (72 hours after the due date), find the row corresponding to each student in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y6aD93aG83O8NmNP304KyGMuMO1dE3VpyDBtWVhoYtI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Information spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>A link to their GitHub repository should automatically be populated, and the latest commit before the late deadline should be populated by a script. If there is an error, then try to find the student&#x27;s repository manually, and look for the latest commit before the late due date.</p>
<p>If a student has an accommodation to submit an assignment more than three days late, see the section on Late Submissions.</p>
<h3 id="email-your-students"><a href="#email-your-students">Email your students</a></h3>
<p>Copy and fill out the following email template and message your students on the Sunday after each project deadline. If the student has not submitted or has extenuating circumstances which have resulted in a need to submit more than 3 days late, do not send them this message but instead do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Schedule a one-off meeting after they finish</li>
<li>Ask an HTA to schedule a one-off meeting with the student</li>
<li>Cancel this week’s meeting and make a plan to fit this week’s material into next week.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="initial-grading"><a href="#initial-grading">Initial grading</a></h3>
<h4 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h4>
<p>Before your block of mentor meetings and after the late deadline, you will do an initial quick grading pass on each student’s submission. In this initial pass, you will give points as conservatively as possible, only for output which is clearly correct. For cases which warrant partial credit, make a note to discuss with the student during your meeting.</p>
<p>For algo submissions, you will simply check the student&#x27;s final answer and make sure a reasonable amount of work is shown. If the student has a correct answer but little work shown, make sure to ask the student to explain their thought process during the meeting.</p>
<p>For code submissions, this initial pass consists of comparing expected output and student output in the corresponding section of the <code>README.md</code> file at the repository root. If the student has not filled out their <code>README.md</code> and does not have an accomodation to submit more than 3 days late, email them and remind them to fill it out. In addition to comparing outputs to evaluate correctness of functionality, you should briefly evaluate the submission&#x27;s code quality and style according to the following general principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organization</strong>: Is there at least some degree of organization, such as separating code into multiple files or functions?</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Is the code reasonably efficient? For example, are there any obvious inefficiencies such as unnecessary loops, redundant calculations, or unnecessary memory allocations or copying?</li>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: Is the code reasonably readable? For example, are there any obvious readability issues such as overly long functions, overly long lines, or overly complex logic?</li>
</ol>

<p>In the student <a href="/docs/mentor-meetings-guide">Mentor Meeting guide</a>, students are given the following instructions for opening their project at the commit id listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y6aD93aG83O8NmNP304KyGMuMO1dE3VpyDBtWVhoYtI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Information spreadsheet</a> (and which you will have emailed to them):</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> to make sure you are on the correct branch and have no uncommitted changes. If you have uncommitted changes, commit them or stash them with <code>git stash</code>. You can unstash them later with <code>git stash pop</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>git checkout &lt;commit id&gt;</code>. This will put you in a detached head state, which is fine.</li>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> again to make sure you are on the correct commit.</li>
<li>Run <code>qtcreator .</code> to open the project in Qt Creator. If you do not have the <code>qtcreator</code> command installed, you can open the project by opening Qt Creator and selecting <code>File &gt; Open File or Project...</code> and selecting the project directory.</li>
